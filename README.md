# Hunt-for-magic 
A First person roguelike dungeon crawler, where you are a wizard fighting through different enemies.
You will find multiple spells during your runs and must learn to combine them to get all the use out of them.
Some spells may even be combined with the environment to create a action packed and fluid combat

This is our school project to create a interesting game demo in four months.
